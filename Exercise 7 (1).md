# Arithmetic Expressions 

```python
# Addition
result_addition = 5 + 3  # Result is 8

# Subtraction
result_subtraction = 10 - 4  # Result is 6

# Multiplication
result_multiplication = 7 * 6  # Result is 42

# Division
result_division = 20 / 5  # Result is 4.0

# Floor Division
result_floor_division = 20 // 3  # Result is 6 (quotient without remainder)

# Modulus
result_modulus = 22 % 5  # Result is 2 (remainder of division)

# Exponentiation
result_exponentiation = 3 ** 4  # Result is 81 (3 raised to the power of 4)
